# System Design Repository

Welcome to the System Design Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for documenting use case analysis and sequence diagrams for our systems.

## Overview

In software development, understanding the various interactions within a system is crucial for its success. Use case analysis and sequence diagrams provide invaluable insights into how users interact with the system and how different components collaborate to achieve desired functionalities.

## Use Case Analysis

Use case analysis outlines the various ways in which users interact with our system. It helps in identifying different user roles, their goals, and the steps involved in achieving those goals. Our repository contains detailed use case analyses for different aspects of our system, ensuring clarity and alignment among stakeholders.

- **User Roles**: Identify different user roles involved in the system.
- **Use Cases**: Describe various actions or tasks users can perform within the system.
- **Scenarios**: Illustrate specific instances of how users interact with the system to accomplish their goals.

## Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams visualise the interactions between different components or actors within the system over time. They provide a chronological representation of how messages are passed between objects and the order in which they occur. Our repository includes comprehensive sequence diagrams that offer a deep understanding of the system's behavior under different scenarios.

- **Component Interaction**: Illustrate how different components or actors collaborate to fulfill a particular use case.
- **Message Flow**: Show the flow of messages between components over time.
- **System Behavior**: Provide insights into the system's behavior under various conditions.
